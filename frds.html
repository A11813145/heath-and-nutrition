<div><p>Junk food is a pejorative term, dating back at least to the 1950s, describing food that is high in calories from sugar or fat, with little dietary fiber, protein, vitamins or minerals. It can also refer to high protein food like meat prepared with saturated fat. The term HFSS foods (high in fat, salt and sugar) is used synonymously. Fast food and fast food restaurants are often equated with junk food, although fast foods cannot be categorically described as junk food.

Concerns about the negative health effects resulting from a junk food-heavy diet, especially obesity, have resulted in public health awareness campaigns, and restrictions on advertising and sale in several countries.

<h1>Origin of the term</h1>
<p>The term junk food dates back at least to the early 1950s, although its coinage has been credited to Michael F. Jacobson of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in 1972. In 1952, it appeared in the Lima, Ohio, News, "'Junk Foods' Cause Serious Malnutrition", the headline for a reprint of a 1948 article from the Ogden, Utah, Standard-Examiner, originally titled, "Dr. Brady’s Health Column: More Junk Than Food". In it, Dr. Brady writes, "What Mrs. H calls 'junk' I call cheat food. That is anything made principally of (1) white flour and or (2) refined white sugar or syrup. For example, white bread, crackers, cake, candy, ice cream soda, chocolate malted, sundaes, sweetened carbonated beverages." The term cheat food can be traced back in newspaper mentions to at least 1916.</p>
<h1>HEALTH PROBLEM</h1>
<p>When junk food is consumed very often, the excess fat, simple carbohydrates, and processed sugar found in junk food contributes to an increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and many other chronic health conditions. A case study on consumption of fast foods in Ghana suggested a direct correlation between consumption of junk food and obesity rates. The report asserts that obesity resulted in related complex health concerns such upsurge of heart attack rates. Studies reveal that as early as the age of 30, arteries could begin clogging and lay the groundwork for future heart attacks. Consumers also tend to eat too much in one sitting, and those who have satisfied their appetite with junk food are less likely to eat healthy foods like fruit or vegetables.

Testing on rats has indicated negative effects of junk food that may manifest likewise in people. A Scripps Research Institute study in 2008 suggested that junk food consumption alters brain activity in a manner similar to addictive drugs like cocaine and heroin. After many weeks with unlimited access to junk food, the pleasure centers of rat brains became desensitized, requiring more food for pleasure; after the junk food was taken away and replaced with a healthy diet, the rats starved for two weeks instead of eating nutritious fare. A 2007 study in the British Journal of Nutrition found that female rats who eat junk food during pregnancy increased the likelihood of unhealthy eating habits in their offspring.

Other research has been done on the impact of sugary foods on emotional health in humans, and has suggested that consumption of junk food can negatively impact energy levels and emotional well-being.</p>

<h2>BEHAVIOUR PROBLEM</h2><div>
<div class="we">
<p>Behavior problems
In a study published in the European<br> Journal</br> of Clinical Nutrition, the frequency of consumption of 57 foods/drinks of 4000 children at the age of four and a half were collected by maternal report. At age seven, the 4000 children were given the <abbr>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire</abbr>SDQ, with five scales: hyperactivity, conduct problems, peer problems, emotional symptoms and pro-social behavior. A one standard deviation increase in junk food was then linked to excessive hyperactivity in 33% of the subjects, leading to the conclusion that children consuming excess junk food at the age of seven are more likely to be in the top third of the hyperactivity scale. There was no significant correlation between junk food and the other scales.</p>

<h2>BY YOGA</h2>
<h3>Importance and Benefits of Yoga</h3>
<p>DIFFERENT POSE FOR DIFFERENT EXERCISE</p><img src="C:\Users\next gen\Downloads\yoga1.jpg">

 <p class="ff">Over the last few decades, there has been an upsurge in the prevalence of yoga. Medical professionals and celebrities are also adopting and recommending the regular practice of yoga due its various benefits. While some regard yoga as simply one more prevailing fashion and associate it with the new age mysticism, others vouch for how astonishing this form of exercise feels. What they don't understand is that what they see as simply just another form of exercise will profit them in ways they never envisioned.
 
Before we get into the benefits of Yoga, it is essential to understand what exactly Yoga really is. Yoga is not a religion, it’s a way of living that aims towards a healthy mind in a healthy body. Man is a physical, mental and spiritual being; Yoga helps in developing the balance between all the three as stated in Ayurveda. Other forms of exercise, like aerobics, only assure physical wellbeing. These exercises have very little to do with the improvement of spiritual or astral body.
 
Yoga is not just about bending or twisting the body and holding the breath. It is a technique to bring you into a state where you see and experience reality simply the way it is. If you enable your energies to become exuberant and ecstatic, your sensory body expands. This enables you to experience the whole universe as a part of yourself, making everything one, this is the union that yoga creates.
 
The founder of Yoga, Patanjali stated, "Sthiram sukham asanam." It implies that a posture that appears to be firm and agreeable is your asana. You may be astounded to know that an asana is just a preliminary step into the act of yoga. It is a way that encourages you to achieve the greater good. Yoga focusses on idealizing concordance between your mind, body, and soul. When you adjust yourself so everything functions brilliantly within you, you will draw out the best of your capabilities.

 <h2>BY MEDITATION</h2>
 <h3>HOW TO INCREASE CONCENTRATION</h3>
 <p>Meditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing their mind on a particular object, thought or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.[1]:228–29[2]:180[3]:415[4]:107[5][6]

Meditation has been practiced since antiquity in numerous religious traditions and beliefs, often as part of the path towards enlightenment and self realisation. Since the 19th century, it has spread from its origins to other cultures where it is commonly practiced in private and business life.

Meditation may be used with the aim of reducing stress, anxiety, depression, and pain, and increasing peace, perception,self-concept, and well-being. Meditation is under research to define its possible health (psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular) and other effects.
